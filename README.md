MarchMadness
=====
Don't you just hate guessing at March Madness.  Well I do too.  This year I
decided to change that by creating a space-age algorithm to help pick teams for 
me.  You can have teams go head to head in a comparison of important basketball 
statistics.  Rebounds, shooting percentage, steals, etc. are all taken into 
account.

## How to use
Run:

    python runner.py
