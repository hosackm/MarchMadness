MarchMadness
=====
Don't you just hate guessing at March Madness.  Well I do too.  This year I decided to change that by creating a space-age algorithm to help pick teams for me.  You can have teams go head to head in a comparison of important basketball statistics.  Rebounds, shooting percentage, steals, etc. are all taken into account.

## How to use
Take a look inside teams.py and find two teams that will be playing each other.  Run compare.py on the command line by passing in the keys of two teams. For example:
`python compare.py wisconsin duke`
